# variable-metadata-test

Test repo to sketch out variable metadata capabilities

Note the variable definitions in vars.json, which include metadata and should impact the prompts received by users.

Conversely, note the in-line variable definition in default/km/entity/Help-Article-2.json; this style will retain
the previous information after it is not matched with a name in the vars.json file
